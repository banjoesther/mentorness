The following codes was used for the cleaning process of the dataset on the power query editor
Query code;

let
    Source = Excel.Workbook(File.Contents("C:\Users\user\Downloads\songs.xlsx"), null, true),
    Sheet1_Sheet = Source{[Item="Sheet1",Kind="Sheet"]}[Data],

    #"Promoted Headers" = Table.PromoteHeaders
	(Sheet1_Sheet, [PromoteAllScalars=true]),

    #"Changed Type" = Table.TransformColumnTypes

	{{"Column1", Int64.Type}, {"video_id", type text}, {"channelTitle", type text}, 
	{"title", type text}, {"description", type text}, {"tags", type text}, 
	{"publishedAt", type datetime}, {"viewCount", Int64.Type},

REVIEWING VISUALS AND CONFIGURATIONS:
Steps used in building each visuals;
In Power BI Desktop, navigate to my report pages.
The following are the documentation of fields used, filters applied, and customizations made.

1. The card visuals which stand for the KPIs as regards the nature of the dataset,
	Total Videos - the 'video_id' field was used as "count(distinct) of video_id"
	Views Count - the 'viewCount' field was used as "count(distinct) of viewCount"
	Likes Count - the 'likeCount' field was used as "count(distinct) of likeCount"
	Comments Count - the 'commentCount' field was used as "count(distinct) of commentCount"
	Favorite Count - the 'favoriteCount' field was used as "count of favoriteCount"	
2. The trends analysis was represented with area chart using;
	'year' and 'viewCount' fields,
	Year on the X-axis, viewCount on the Y-axis
3. The comparism between months was represented with a clustered column chart using;
	'month' and 'likeCount' fields,
	Month on the X-axis, likeCount on the Y-axis
4. The proportion of video quality was represented with a donut chart using;
	'definition' and 'viewCount' fields
	'definition' as the legend, and 'viewCount' to measure the proportion of legend
5. The months(6) that had the most comments count was represented with a clustered bar chart using;
	'month' and 'commentCount' fields,
	Month on the Y-axis, commentCount on X-axis
6. The proportion of caption was visualized with a pie chart using;
	'caption' and 'video_id' fields
	'caption' as the legend, and 'video_id' to measure the proportion of legend
7. The slicers used on the dashboard for filtering are;
	*date slicer using 'date' field,
	*caption slicer using 'caption' field,
	*video quality(definition) slicer using 'definition' field
8. Button for clearing filter was added by
	navigate to insert tab > buttons > bookmark > shape = 'pill',
	style > text = 'clear filters', 'fill' = on,
	action > type = 'bookmark', bookmark = 'clear'

	CONFIGURATION AND CUSTOMIZATION
A title was added to the dashboard with a picture to depict the brand's name and a text box
	insert tab > image > browse the saystem to select your image
	'YOUTUBE SONGS ANALYSIS REPORT'
	Then resize to fit the required space and place well.
All visuals were formatted having the following;
	A title 
	A divider
	Chosen color of red to fit the brand's color
	Fonts increased 15pts and formatted to black and bold
	Data labels
	Tooltips 
Then the general customization for all visuals has the following effects;
	Visual borders > color = black,
			 rounded corners = 10pts for cards and slicers, 15pts for visuals
	Shadow > color = black,
		 offset = outside,
		 position = bottom right
The background of the report canvas remains white.

All customization and configuration process was the same for the insights page.
