Question 1 - What is the total number of reservations in the dataset?
Query - SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Booking_ID) AS total_reservations 
	FROM hotelreserve; --this is to make sure there are no duplicate values
			Otherwise,
	SELECT COUNT(Booking_ID) AS total_reservations 
	FROM hotelreserve;

Question 2 - Which meal plan is the most popular among guests?
Query - SELECT type_of_meal_plan, COUNT(*) AS most_popular 
	FROM hotelreserve
	GROUP  BY type_of_meal_plan
	ORDER BY most_popular DESC
	LIMIT 1;


Question 3 - What is the average price per room for reservations involving children?
Query - SELECT ROUND(AVG(avg_price_per_room), 2) AS avg_roomprice_with_children
	FROM hotelreserve
	WHERE no_of_children > 0;


Question 4 - How many reservations were made for the year 20XX (replace XX with the desired year)?

Note - My desired year is 2018

Query - SELECT year(arrival_date) as desired_year, COUNT(*) AS reservation_count
        FROM hotelreserve
        WHERE YEAR(arrival_date) = 2018
        GROUP BY desired_year;


Question 5 - What is the most commonly booked room type?
Query - SELECT room_type_reserved, COUNT(*) AS commonly_booked
	FROM hotelreserve 
	GROUP BY room_type_reserved 
	ORDER BY commonly_booked DESC
	LIMIT 1;


Question 6 - How many reservations fall on a weekend (no_of_weekend_nights > 0)?
Query - SELECT SUM(no_of_weekend_nights) AS total_weekend_reservations 
	FROM hotelreserve
	WHERE no_of_weekend_nights > 0;


Question 7 - What is the highest and lowest lead time for reservations?
Query - SELECT
	(SELECT MAX(lead_time) FROM hotelreserve) AS highest_leadtime,
	(SELECT MIN(lead_time) FROM hotelreserve) AS lowest_leadtime;


Question 8 - What is the most common market segment type for reservations?
Query - SELECT DISTINCT market_segment_type, COUNT(*) AS count_market

Question 9 - How many reservations have a booking status of "Confirmed"?

Firstly update the table to set the booking_status column value of 'Not Canceled' to 'Confirmed'
Query - UPDATE hotelreserve

	WHERE booking_status = "Not_Canceled";
		Then this answers the question
Query - SELECT DISTINCT booking_status, COUNT(*) AS confirmed_reservations 
	FROM hotelreserve
	WHERE booking_status = "Confirmed"
	GROUP BY booking_status;

	FROM hotelreserve;


Question 11 - What is the average number of weekend nights for reservations involving children?
Query - SELECT ROUND(AVG(no_of_weekend_nights), 2) AS avg_weekend_nights_Children

	WHERE no_of_children > 0;


Question 12 - How many reservations were made in each month of the year?
Query - SELECT MONTHNAME(arrival_date) AS month, COUNT(*) AS reservations_by_months

	GROUP BY room_type_reserved
	ORDER BY room_type_reserved;


Qustion 14 - For reservations involving children, what is the most common room type, and what is the average

Query - SELECT room_type_reserved, ROUND(AVG(avg_price_per_room), 2) AS average_price
	FROM hotelreserve
	WHERE no_of_children > 0

	AND room_type_reserved = 
	(

	SELECT room_type_reserved FROM hotelreserve
	WHERE no_of_children > 0
	GROUP BY room_type_reserved
	ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC
	LIMIT 1
	)
	GROUP BY room_type_reserved;


Question 15 - Find the market segment type that generates the highest average price per room.
Query - SELECT market_segment_type, ROUND(AVG(avg_price_per_room), 0) AS highest_avg_room_price
